# Phalcon Box

Phalcon strives to get closer to developers, providing flexible, powerful and simple tools.
We would like a Phalcon development process to be effortless and pleasant from deployment of the development environment
to the programming in [Zephir](https://github.com/phalcon/zephir) language.

Phalcon Box is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box that provides you a wonderful development environment without
requiring you to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine.
