# Phalcon Box

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phalcon/box.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phalcon/box)

Phalcon strives to get closer to developers, providing flexible, powerful and simple tools.
We would like a Phalcon development process to be effortless and pleasant from deployment of the development environment
to the programming in [Zephir](https://github.com/phalcon/zephir) language.

----------

Phalcon Box is an official, pre-packaged [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) box that provides you a wonderful development
environment without requiring you to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine.

## Documentation

The current version can be seen at [docs.phalconphp.com](https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/environments-vagrant).
